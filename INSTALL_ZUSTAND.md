# Install Zustand

To enable local state persistence, please run:

```bash
npm install zustand
```

This will install Zustand state management library which is used to:
- Store nodes and edges in localStorage
- Persist flow state across page refreshes
- Manage global flow state

After installation, the flow store will automatically save and restore your workflow positions and connections.
